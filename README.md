# Planetarium
A solar system simulation for university

## Content
In this repository you can find:
+ The code for executing the program
+ An animated gif of the execution

## Code Guide
In the draw function we have three main function calls:
### drawSun()
This function draws and gives style to the sun.
### drawPlanets()
This function draws and gives style and movement to the different drawn planets. 
In addition this function calls drawSatellite which draws a satellite around Jupiter planet.
### drawShip()
This function draws and gives style and movement to the spaceShip.


## Controls
When executing the code you can move the spaceShip in two ways:

### Simple movement
You can move the spaceship throw different axis:
+ For Y axis use "w" and "s"
+ For X axis use "a" and "d"
+ For Z axis use "r" and "f"

### Change orientation
You can change the orientation:
+ For Y axis use "8" and "2"
+ For X axis use "7" and "9"
+ For Z axis use "4" and "6"
